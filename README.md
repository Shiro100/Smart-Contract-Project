# Error Handler Smart Contract

This Solidity smart contract demonstrates the implementation of error handling mechanisms, such as `require`, `assert`, and `revert`, to manage inputs and contract logic. It includes basic functionality to set a value and perform division, with custom error messages to ensure proper validation.

## Description

This contract, written in Solidity, implements two primary functions:

1. **Setting a Value**: Ensures that the value being set is greater than 0 and is different from the previous value.
2. **Performing Division**: Ensures that division by zero is prevented and only values divisible by the denominator can be used.

Additionally, this contract demonstrates how to handle custom error messages for better input validation and smart contract reliability.

## Getting Started

### Running the Program

To run this contract, you can use [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/), a web-based Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

1. **Visit Remix IDE**: Go to [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/).
2. **Create a New File**: In the left sidebar, click the "+" icon to create a new file. Save it with a `.sol` extension (e.g., `ErrorHandler.sol`).
3. **Copy and Paste the Code**: Copy the following code and paste it into your newly created file.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

contract ErrorHandlingExample {
    uint public storedValue;

    function updateValue(uint newValue) public {
        assert(newValue != storedValue); // Assert placed here
        storedValue = newValue;
    }

    function safeDivision(uint numerator, uint denominator) public pure returns (uint) {
        if (numerator % denominator != 0) {
            revert("Numerator is not divisible by the denominator."); // Revert placed here
        }
        
        require(denominator != 0, "Division by zero is not allowed."); // Require placed here
        return numerator / denominator;
    }
}

```

4. **Compile the Code**: In the "Solidity Compiler" tab (on the left sidebar), set the compiler version to `0.8.28` (or any compatible version). Click **Compile `ErrorHandler.sol`**.
5. **Deploy the Contract**: Go to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab, select `ErrorHandlerContract` from the dropdown menu, and click **Deploy**.
6. **Interact with the Contract**: Once deployed, you can interact with the contract:
   - **Set Value**: Use the `setValue` function to set a new value, ensuring it’s greater than 0 and different from the previous value.
   - **Perform Division**: Use the `performDivision` function to divide two numbers, ensuring the numerator is divisible by the denominator and the denominator is not zero.
