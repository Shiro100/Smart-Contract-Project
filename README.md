# Smart Contract

A simple Solidity contract that allows setting a state value with validation and performing safe division between two numbers. It ensures the new value is positive and different from the current one, and that division operations are only performed when the denominator is non-zero and divisible.

## Description
This contract provides basic functionality to interact with a state variable value and includes two key functions:

setValue: Allows you to set a new value for the state variable value. It ensures that the new value is different from the current one and that it is greater than zero.

performDivision: Performs a division operation between two unsigned integers (_numerator and _denominator). It checks to ensure that the denominator is not zero and that the numerator is divisible by the denominator before performing the division.
