### Solidity Error Handling Contract
This Solidity contract showcases how to incorporate error handling techniques into smart contracts. It provides basic features for assigning a value and executing division, while demonstrating the use of `require`, `assert`, and `revert` to enforce input validation and ensure correct contract behavior. This example is designed to help developers grasp how to manage errors and control logic flow in a smart contract environment.

### Contract Overview
This Solidity-based contract incorporates two core functionalities: assigning a new value and performing division. It utilizes basic error checks to ensure that:

The new value is positive and not identical to the previous one.
Division by zero is prevented.
The numerator is divisible by the denominator without remainder.
The contract also demonstrates the use of require, assert, and revert for handling custom error messages, offering a fundamental approach for building more resilient and dependable smart contracts.
