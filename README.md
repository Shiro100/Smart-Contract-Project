### Solidity Error Handling Contract
This Solidity contract showcases how to incorporate error handling techniques into smart contracts. It provides basic features for assigning a value and executing division, while demonstrating the use of `require`, `assert`, and `revert` to enforce input validation and ensure correct contract behavior. This example is designed to help developers grasp how to manage errors and control logic flow in a smart contract environment.
